Puzzle Style Video Game


This game was designed and implemented by Samuel Mendheim. The purpose of the game is to give the player small puzzles to solve with increasing difficulty. The first is the facotry, a relatively simple puzzle for the player to get the feel of the game, the second is the mansion with a slightly bigger map and more puzzles. The third is the office with a very difficult puzzle to solve and a sarcastic computer that does not help the player at all.
